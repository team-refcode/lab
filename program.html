<p>The purpose of this curriculum is not to offer comprehensive coverage of all the things needed for general
computer literacy or all of the prerequisites to learning to code. There would be too many things to list and 
it would be burdensome for every student to go through it all. The purpose of Refcode Lab is to provide an 
informal guided learning environment where tutors are able to identify areas for growth and provide guidance
in the moment.</p>
<p>This curriculum aims to cover some key basics that are important for everyone to learn as well as to touch
upon some areas that are commonly problematic or needing specific attention. It also provides a framework for
beginning the journey to advanced computer usage and coding. It shoudl be underscored again and again to both
tutors and students that this curriculum is not complete or comprehensive in any way. It is a skeleton
framework which will give a brief introduction to some of the broad areas of coding. As students progress
through this material, the goal is that they will find areas that they want to dig deeper, or they will learn
about tangental topics that interest them and which they want to explore. This curriculum should not tie down
a motivated and self-directed learner. Once a learner begins to form their own journey of learning, then this
curriculum has served its purpose and may be discarded.</p>
